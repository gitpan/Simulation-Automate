Simulation/Automate version 1.0.1
=====================================

Simulation::Automate ('SynSim') is a generic template-driven simulation automation tool. It works with any simulator that accepts text input files and generates text output. It executes thousands of simulations with different input files automatically, and processes the results. Postprocessing facilities include basic statistical analysis and automatic generation of PostScript plots with Gnuplot. SynSim is entirely modular, making it easy to add your own analysis and postprocessing routines.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install (or
   make localinstall
   for a local installation)

To create your local project setup, you can use

   make setup

If you can't do a perl-style install, run the local_install.pl script. It will ask you where you want to install SynSim, and copy all the relevant files there.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires no other modules, but to make use of the 
postprocessing facilities, you'll need gnuplot 
http://www.ucc.ie/gnuplot/gnuplot.html
To view the generated plots, you'll need a PostScript viewer. I use
gv (http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~plass/gv/) or ggv (http://www.gnome.org/softwaremap/projects/ggv/)
